# Nim bindings for FrintJS

[FrintJS](https://frint.js.org/) is a powerful reactive, modular web framework for Micro Frontends, 
leveraging RxJS.

FrintJS has built-in support for:

- React
- Vue
- Reaxt Native
- Preact

Frint looks AMAZING!!

## TODO

Add Frint binding modules for:

- `frint-store` State management with reactive stores
- `frint-data` Reactive data modelling
- `frint-react` React.js integration
- `frint-react-server` Rerver-side rendering of Apps
- `frint-router` Router services for building Single Page Applications
- `frint-router-react` React components for building SPAs
- `frint-model`

Update the Frint CLI to generate Nim code with bindings to FrintJS and RxJS

- `frint-cli` CLI runner
